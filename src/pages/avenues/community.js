			"Kindred Kidneys is a community service initiative by the Rotaract Club of Alumni of University of Moratuwa, launched in 2019 to aid Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients in Sri Lanka. In its fourth year, the project expanded with two subprojects: Kindred Kidneys Scholarship Program: This ongoing program supports students from families affected by CKD, aiming to alleviate their financial burdens. It provides a sustainable solution to help families cover the costs associated with CKD diagnosis. Scholarships, each worth LKR 5000, were granted to four students from financially unstable backgrounds in Padaviya and Kesbawa. The program ran throughout the year, ensuring continued support during the club's administration transition. Six sponsors supported this initiative. Kindred Kidneys Donation Phase: This phase aimed to fulfill essential needs of CKD patients by supporting the Samastha Lanka Kidney Patients' Association (SLKPA). A donation of Rs. 118,000.00 was made, which covered the purchase of 12 Dialysis kits (valued at Rs. 101,285,000.00) and cyclosporine tablets (Rs. 27,610.47) to aid kidney patients' treatment. SLKPA is a prominent healthcare organization in Sri Lanka, and this donation helped address CKD patients' medical needs during challenging economic times.",
